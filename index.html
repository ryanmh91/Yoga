                <p>What Is Hatha Yoga? Hatha yoga focuses on posture and breathing techniques, traditionally to channel vital energy
                source. In Sanskrit, Hatha translates to force. The practice involves breath, body, and mind, and classes are usually 45
                minutes to 90 minutes of breathing, yoga poses, and meditation.</p>

                <p>Vinyasa Flow yoga emphasizes the sequential movement between postures, coordinated with and guided by deliberate breath.

                <h3>Restorative Yoga</h3>
                <p>Restorative yoga enables deep relaxation as you holding poses for longer periods of time with the help of props to
                completely support you. The main focus of Restorative Yoga is that by relaxing in poses, with the aid of props, without
                strain or pain, we can achieve physical, mental and emotional relaxation.</p>
