                    Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength.

                    Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower back pain. The American
                    College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment for chronic low back pain.

                Gentle yoga has been shown to ease some of the discomfort of tender, swollen joints for people with arthritis, according
                to a Johns Hopkins review of 11 recent studies.

                    Regular yoga practice may reduce levels of stress and body-wide inflammation, contributing to healthier hearts. Several
                    of the factors contributing to heart disease, including high blood pressure and excess weight, can also be addressed
                    through yoga.
